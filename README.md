# Research Computing Services

Along with our cluster resources, the Stanford Research Computing Center offers 
several services for software engineering, continuous integration and pipeline 
development, and reproducible research to publish and archive associated 
software for research. Our services are available to any Stanford University
or Stanford School of Medicine researcher or affiliate.

## Services Offered

 - Consulting to analyze the software engineering practices and reproducible practices of your lab, and space for improvement.
 - Containerization of your software repository (Docker and Singularity) so it is ready to run on local resources or cloud
 - Version controlled recipes and templates for the needs of yourlab
 - Continuous Integration development and setup for the continual testing of your code
 - Detailed documentation and/or tutorials for your software and tools.
 - Development of scripts to run an analysis across the sherlock cluster, and running for you.
 - Review of your manuscripts to address potential reviewer issues with reproducible practices.

## Levels of Service

For any support needed, we offer:

 - support funding built into a grant application
 - a contract level based on estimated hours for a predefined project
 - a flat fee for components requested regardless of timing
 - support based on an hourly fee, with regular updates

We are here to help you to perform the highest quality research and want you to be
successful. We are highly trained in computational workflows, reproducible practices,
and software engineering, and some domain science and can help with many small
and large components of your research.
